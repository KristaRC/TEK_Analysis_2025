The subsistence patterns of local communities can include extensive ecological knowledge,   effective harvest techniques, traditions for cooperation and sharing, and cultural ceremonial   activities.     Subsistence activities involve hunting, fishing, trapping, and collecting (ADF&G 2010m).  A   wide array of natural resources is harvested throughout the year in a regular cycle of seasonal   efforts timed for availability, access, and condition of the resources.  The composition of   subsistence harvests includes many species of fish, land mammals, marine mammals and   invertebrates, terrestrial invertebrates, waterfowl, berries, plants, and firewood gathering.  People   rely on these locally available resources for food, clothing, fuel, transportation, construction, art,   crafts, exchange, and customary trade (Wolfe 2000).   The use of traditional food in the subsistence lifestyle provides important benefits to users.    Subsistence foods are often preferable as they are rich in many nutrients, lower in fat, and   considered healthier than purchased foods.  Subsistence harvesting of traditional foods, including   preparation, eating, and sharing of resources, contributes to the social, cultural, and spiritual   well-being of....",74,,,0,2,

It would also harm the well-being of residents living close to the    unique natural resource.  Despite that Asian carp may present an opportunity for subsistence    harvests, Asian carp species may significantly damage subsistence harvests of native species    from the Great Lakes and reduce the social, cultural and spiritual values of the lakes and lake-   related activities.  Subsistence harvests may be impacted due to 1) changes in the ecosystem    which may result in less native species as well as poor food quality for subsistence harvesters    with negative impacts on subsistence harvesters and communities, and 2) gaining access to    subsistence fishing may be impaired or may require travelling greater distances which will    increase costs of harvesting.  This will weaken traditional knowledge and observations, and    inter-generational transfer of knowledge and culture.  Finally, the presence of Asian carp may    also increase the level of competition among subsistence harvesters/communities for fewer    native fish species as well as between subsistence users and recreational/commercial users.         There is uncertainty about the impacts of Asian carp in the DPR-U ecosystem.  Asian carp have    measurable effects on native planktivores in areas of high Asian carp abundance.  What is less    conclusive are the population level effects resulting from interactions between native    planktivores and Asian carp.  ",74,,,0,2,

In ethnographic   interviews, tribal members referred to a number of culturally preferred riparian and marsh   plant species that are said to have declined in population in the last century.  Foremost   among these is the yellow pond lily (Wocus), a source of edible seeds that has served as   one of the most important staple plant foods of The Klamath Tribes.  The decline in some   riparian plant species may correlate with declines in the fish population of the Upper   Klamath Basin and may reflect the reduction in nutrient loading to marsh plant   procurement areas.       Prior to the extirpation of anadromous salmonids from the Upper Klamath Basin, salmon   were the focus of a complex of cultural traditions, including distinctive fish harvesting   and processing technologies; traditional ecological knowledge relating to fish habitats   and behavior; and ritual traditions centering significantly on the maintenance of   harvestable fish populations through ceremonial displays of respect for the fish, the   Creator, and other spiritual forces said to influence the return of the fish.  Through such   practices, The Klamath Tribes have always played an active role in the stewardship of   anadromous fish resources, and many contemporary tribal members perceive this role as   a cultural right and responsibility.      The absence of the fish has compromised the ability of members of The Klamath Tribes   to pass knowledge from generation to generation relating to the fish and their harvest.    The importance of salmon harvest is further reflected in The Klamath Tribes' languages,   place names, songs, stories, and the moral teachings provided to children.  Large   gatherings associated with the fish harvest once served as a venue for economic   exchanges, reunion with kin from other communities, and the forging",70,,,1,2,

These contributing factors have led to the decline of the anadromous fishery     and other inter-related aquatic populations important to the continuance of an Indian     river-based way of life.  The decline of the anadromous fishery is directly and indirectly     linked to the decline and scattering of the people, culture and language of the ?Salmon     People? of the Klamath Basin.  The decline is manifested particularly in physical illness,     mental illness, the loss of traditional knowledge, and social conflict among native peoples     and between native peoples and non-natives also residing in the Klamath Basin (DOI     2011a2).

Foremost   among these is the yellow pond lily (Wocus), a source of edible seeds that has served as   one of the most important staple plant foods of The Klamath Tribes.  The decline in some   riparian plant species may correlate with declines in the fish population of the Upper   Klamath Basin and may reflect the reduction in nutrient loading to marsh plant   procurement areas.     Prior to the extirpation of anadromous salmonids from the Upper Klamath Basin, salmon   were the focus of a complex of cultural traditions, including distinctive fish harvesting   and processing technologies; traditional ecological knowledge relating to fish habitats   and behavior; and ritual traditions centering significantly on the maintenance of   harvestable fish populations through ceremonial displays of respect for the fish, the   Creator, and other spiritual forces said to influence the return of the fish.  Through such   practices, The Klamath Tribes have always played an active role in the stewardship of   anadromous fish resources, and contemporary tribal members perceive this role as a   cultural right and responsibility.     The absence of the fish has compromised the ability of members of The Klamath Tribes   to pass knowledge from generation to generation relating to the fish and their harvest.    The importance of salmon harvest is further reflected in The Klamath Tribes' languages,   place names, songs, stories, and the moral teachings provided to children.

These contributing factors have led to the decline of the anadromous fishery   and other inter-related aquatic populations important to the continuance of an Indian   river-based way of life.  The decline of the anadromous fishery is directly and indirectly   linked to the decline and scattering of the people, culture and language of the ""Salmon   People"" of the Klamath Basin.  The decline is manifested particularly in physical illness,   mental illness, the loss of traditional knowledge, and social conflict among native peoples   and between native peoples and non-natives also residing in the Klamath Basin (DOI   2012).

In 1834, the Mexican   government secularized the missions, freeing the Native Americans from the control of the   missionaries. Returning to their traditional way of life was difficult, however, since land holdings   were given to Mexican settlers (""Californios"") rather than reverting to original ownership. A few   Native Americans were granted land, but records show that, for the most part, the indigenous   people quickly lost ownership through land claims disputes and sales. Native people became   increasingly marginalized as a result of decreasing population, the stresses of mission life, and the   erosion of traditional knowledge. Some Native Americans returned to their villages and resumed   their traditional economy, replacing bows and arrows with guns. Others found jobs as vaqueros,   or cowboys, on the ranchos operated by Mexican settlers. Census records show the number of   Native Americans declined steadily into the 20th century.

Less   intensive surveys are conducted in habitats with lower potential for supporting rare species. If   species are designated as Region 2 Sensitive or SOLC after surveys in a given area are complete,   additional, focused surveys are performed on the basis of site priority to ensure the area has been   surveyed for all managed plant species. Botanical survey data are stored in the BHNF plants database   (USDA Forest Service 2016).   ",,2,

According to an ANTHC report on climate change in Nuiqsut, residents are     reporting noticeable changes in weather, plants, animals, and the land, and these     changes are raising concerns about food and water security, transportation safety, and     increased stress affecting mental health (ANTHC 2014).     3.20.5.4 Traditional Knowledge     Nuiqsut residents have expressed concerns about potential health impacts from Project     emissions and oil spills; potential effects to subsistence access and resource availability;     potential hazards associated with changes in travel patterns; and access to advanced     health care:      After 2012, a lot of the kids and elderly people had respiratory issues. ...A lot of times the     doctors don't know what's causing it. (Nanushuk Cooperating Agency Meeting, April 27,     2017; regarding respiratory issues)      My hunting areas are being impacted, sick fish and caribou. The pollution is going to     have a major effect on our food. (Nanushuk Cooperating Agency Meeting, April 27,     2017; regarding potential for contamination of subsistence resources)     It is a health and safety hazard to have to go further and further. Young hunters need to     carry more gas than they need.  (SRB&A 2009; regarding transportation safety)     We do have a free health clinic, but that doesn't help if you get  ",1,2,

While ""salmon runs once thought to  be inextinguishable were decimated in a short time"" thanks to the large-scale fishing operations  introduced by white settlers, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) as well as focused energy have  brought renewed vigor back into maintaining healthy salmon populations. Additionally, a long-standing  antagonistic relationship between the government and tribal entities has softened considerably, as  decades of cooperation have begun to write a new narrative in the face of previous injustices. The Boldt  decision and others like it demonstrate the efficacy of tribal co-management. And Bears Ears is a  fantastic opportunity to invoke it.  ",,2,

Around the world, it is increasingly challenging for indigenous communities to maintain cultures,  livelihoods, and traditional food sources in the face of climate change (IPCC 2014a citing Crate and  Nuttall 2009 and Rybråten and Hovelsrud 2010; GCRP 2014 citing Lynn et al. 2013). The impacts of  climate change are expected to be more significant in places where indigenous people live and on  traditional ecological knowledge (IPCC 2018 citing Olsson et al. 2014). Many studies indicate that further  significant changes in the natural resource base would negatively affect indigenous cultures, particularly  if people are confined to particular territories created by treaties; if natural resources are lost within  that territory, that is a permanent loss to the tribe and their culture (GCRP 2018a; IPCC 2014a citing  Crate 2008, Gregory and Trousdale 2009, and Jacka 2009). For example, climate change is causing  changes in the range and abundance of culturally important plant and animal species, reducing the  availability of and access to traditional foods, and increasing damage to tribal homes and cultural sites  (GCRP 2014 citing Lynn et al. 2013, Voggesser et al. 2013, and Karuk Tribe 2010).

Examples of  adaptation measures to improve livelihoods and well-being include diversification of income-generating  activities in agricultural and fishing systems, development of insurance systems, and provision of  education for women. Integration of local and traditional knowledge is found to increase the  effectiveness of adaptation strategies. Improvements in entitlements and rights, as well as engagement  of indigenous peoples in decision-making, increase their social and cultural resilience to climate change  (IPCC 2014a). There is not enough evidence on the effectiveness of migration and resettlement as  adaptation. Migration is costly and disruptive and is thus often perceived as an adaptation of last resort  (IPCC 2014a citing McLeman 2009). Poorly designed adaptation strategies can increase the risk of  conflict and amplify vulnerabilities in certain populations, if they exacerbate existing inequalities or  grievances over resources (IPCC 2014a).     Local and traditional knowledge is a valuable source of information for adapting to climate change (IPCC  2014a, GCRP 2014). There is high agreement in the literature that the integration of local and traditional  and scientific knowledge increases adaptive capacity (IPCC 2014a citing Kofinas et al. 2002, Oberthür et  al. 2004, Tyler et al. 2007,   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,73,,,,2,

While being an important resource for adaptation, traditional knowledge may be  insufficient to respond to rapidly changing ecological conditions or unexpected or infrequent risks (IPCC  2014a, GCRP 2014). As a result, current traditional knowledge strategies could be inadequate to manage  projected climate changes (IPCC 2014a citing Wittrock et al. 2011). While adaptation is possible to avoid  some losses of cultural assets and expressions, cultural integrity will still be compromised if climate  change erodes livelihoods, sense of place, and traditional practices (IPCC 2014a).

It is a multi-criteria decision analysis framework  that utilizes the best available empirical fish and habitat data; peer-reviewed, published research  evidence; and local knowledge to determine the highest-priority areas and actions for habitat  improvement within a watershed. It integrates geographical information system (GIS) data  relating to the limiting factors in an assessment unit to identify ""biologically significant reaches,""  and results in scored restoration opportunities, displayed on a map within a hierarchical spatial  framework (Booth et al. 2016).

The subsistence economy for residents of Southeast Alaska is strong, and the reliance upon fishing,  hunting and gathering takes an understanding of the available habitat and environment.    Response 014: The EIS evaluates the effects of the alternatives relative to subsistence at the  programmatic level. The EIS, including Appendix E, discusses the potential effects of the  proposed Alaska Roadless Rule, including six alternatives, on 32 communities in Southeast  Alaska. Appendix E in the FEIS has been revised to include an assessment of potential  subsistence impacts at the community level.

Many of the traditional Nuwuvi songs describe details about the landscape and locations within the Spring  Mountains.

Understanding of the intricate web of nature is often elicited   through the study of Traditional Ecological Knowledge, one aspect of which acknowledges the   past as a time when people and animals understood one another, and are still considered relatives       Many of the natural resources in the Canyons are considered cultural resources by the   Tribes. Plants have an important role in Hopi culture; they are used in ceremonies and serve as   clan totems, as medicines, in farming and food production, and for innumerable utilitarian   purposes. During Hopi ethnobotanical research in the Canyons, 141 plant species were identified   as culturally significant. Many important plant species specifically associated with water are   found throughout the Canyons. Beyond the direct role plants play in human life, they are also   recognized by the Hopi as a vital component of the ecosystem, which provides a habitat for   many forms of animal life       According to the Navajo guiding principles, or teachings about plants, first and foremost,   plants are people, and like people they move around,",70,,,1,2,

The United States    continues to work with Indian tribes on a government-to - government basis to address issues concerning    Indian tribal self -government tribal trust resources, and Indian tribal treaty and other rights.    The MMS incorporates a government-to -government consultation process within all prelease and postlease    regulatory policy decisions that have tribal implications, to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal    officials. This process includes early consultation with tribal officials. The MMS conducts a government    to -government dialog with Native groups, both in formal agency meetings and in the open public forum    throughout the pre- lease and NEPA processes.

True restoration of    environmental damage, according to Picou and Gill ( 1996) : ""must include the reestablishment of a social    equilibrium between the biophysical environment and the human community"" (Field et al. , 1999 ;    Nighswander and Peacock, 1999 ; Fall et al . , 1999) . Since 1995 , subsistence restoration resulting from the    EVOS has improved by taking a more comprehensive approach by partnering with local communities and    by linking scientific methodologies with traditional knowledge (Fall et al . , 1999; Fall and Utermohle,    1999 ).

Relict trees were  selected, since they were present prior to cutover in the late 1800-early 1900's and would  be accurate portrayers of historical occurrence of longleaf. However, every criteria  developed (e.g. longleaf from crest of ridge downslope XX% on a southerly exposure, on  longleaf soils), proved to have a supportive example on the ground, as well as a no-  supportive example. In essence, the map would only be as accurate as the criteria used  for developing it, thereby producing a map that was neither accurate nor helpful.

I always ask around if there was any damage that was caused... .Research done before the  oil spill was by observation-looking at the quantity of what was there before. NOAA has books  from the sixties. But there are no studies of contamination in the wild resources. They are using  more potent chemicals to wipe off boats.

Overall water quality and the elimination of discharges into marine waters is a growing concern with local  stakeholders, especially among regional subsistence hunters.    The MMS supports initiatives to train village oil-spill-response teams as a way of guaranteeing local  participation in spill-response and cleanup; this effort provides a form of control and allows local Native  communities to use their traditional knowledge about weather and currents in the response process. Within  the constraints of Federal, State, and local law, operators and Cook Inlet Spill Prevention and Response,  Inc. would be encouraged, through a voluntary program, to hire and train Native residents of the Cook  Inlet/Shelikof Strait region in oil-spill response and cleanup.    The MMS also is working with the oil industry to develop a comprehensive plan for dealing with  subsistence claims, should an oil spill occur. The plan would include what constitutes proof of previous  subsistence activities, what information is needed to support a claim, and how subsistence losses would be  calculated for restitution. The object would be to develop a subsistence claim process manual that sets out  the protocol for a subsistence hunter to follow in filing a claim.

The mitigating measures for addressing the major concerns that surfaced  at the scoping meetings is to apply all or some of the standard stipulations and JTLs to each lease  sale agreerrent. The two deferrals, offered as Alternatives HI and IV. would lessen impacts on  some of the subsistence species, however, the EIS should clearly identify which ITL(5) and  standard strpulation(s) would apply to each Alternative.

Our responsibility to our future generations use  of these resources is imperative, not only to our children and the seven generations to  come but because your own future generations need to be able to use and have access to  the resources in an safe manner. The environment can exist without us, but we cannot  exist without our environment.  ",74,,,,2,

The cemetery possessed no art or architec-  ture to elevate it to potentially eligible status, and it was located within a modern housing  addition, but its association caused the historians to probe the idea of African American  settlement further. The historians contacted OCP to see if other properties remained  regarding African American settlement in the county. OCP was unaware of any proper-  ties but provided a local person who has knowledge of the history of this area.    Further, because the town of ""Freedom"" was located nearby, the historians queried both  OCP and the local knowledgeable person to see if either party knew of an association with the theme ""Free Blacks in the Antebellum Era"" and the town of Freedom. Although  neither was aware of any such association at that time (they have since found that the  two may be linked), the historians evaluated Freedom as a potential district. (The project  historians have studied Free Black Settlement in Indiana and they found association  between the Quaker settlement of Freedom, the nearby African American cemetery, and  the number of known African Americans gleaned from the census records too strong not  to examine the town, even though neither local source was aware of a connection.) As a  result of field reconnaissance, the project historians found that the town had few, if any,  resources of that time period; most of the construction is from a later date.

Instead,     and the Idaho DEIS so articulates, lek buffers must be developed in conjunction with local knowledge of     Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal movements and population responses to management actions. For the Idaho LUPA, lek buffers must be analyzed to provide greater flexibility and adaptability to make changes to buffers as new information and science becomes available and if the site will allow for a more flexible approach. Commenters support a ""not a one-size-fits-all approach"" as stated in the DEIS. But more importantly, Commenters pause to offer how the imposition of potentially inflexible lek buffer requirements potentially collide with the full range of applicable laws that authorize and encourage mining on public lands, including the General Mining Law of 1872, the Surface Use Act, the Mining and Materials Policy Act, FLPMA, and the implementing regulations of those statutes.

Since the ROD, CPAI has conducted multiple years of exploration    drilling that has enhanced our (and the BLM's) understanding of the subsurface structures. This new information has    led us to the conclusion that attaining economic viability for a development outside the existing buffer zone is not    possible. This information, combined with the fact that the 3-mile setback had no scientific or traditional knowledge    basis (i.e. the original suggestion from Kuukpik Corporation was 1.5 miles) serves to support our contention that the    current setback is unreasonable and ultimately not economic (for development) based on current knowledge.

Community-Based Management    Communities are created when people live or work together for a long enough time to generate  local societies. Community members associate to meet common needs and express common  interests, and relationships built over many generations lead to common cultural values and  understandings through which people relate to each other and to their environment. At this point,  collective action may be taken to protect local resources if they appear threatened, scarce, or  subject to overexploitation. This is known as community-based resource management.    As ecosystem principles shift the focus of fishery management from species to places, increased  participation from the primary stakeholders (i.e., community members) can enhance marine  management by (a) incorporating local knowledge regarding specific locations and ecosystem  conditions; (b) encouraging the participation of stakeholders in the management process, which  has been shown to lead to improved data collection and compliance; and (c) improving  relationships between communities and often centralized government agencies (Dyer and  McGoodwin 1994).

The new information may have a bearing on the analyses and mitigation that should be included in the final EIS and biological assessment.   At least one survey of a known cave system is incomplete. A cave system near Beaver Lake that has the potential to support the Ozark cavefish was only recently explored. The divers report that visibility was too low to conduct surveys. Another attempt will be made when water levels in the lake subside. The status of this survey is relevant since this specific cave habitat would be affected by the eastem-most alignments of the project connectors to Highway 412.   In addition, local knowledge about cave systems may be presented for consideration during the upcoming public hearings and meetings. Presumably, this would include information currently unknown to us.   "" Of the alternative alignments presented in the draft EIS, Alternative 5, the northern-most, appears to have the highest potential to adversely impact the Cave Springs recharge area and other fish and wildlife resources. The northern alignment area is very important to the Cave Springs system, which supports the largest known population of Ozark cavefish. The alternative alignment is approximately two miles outside of the recharge area, but the potential for secondary and cumulative effects through highway-related sprawl development in such a rapidly growing area of the State is quite high.   The Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport is also proposing to construct an access road corridor to connect with the project.

The surveyors interviewed subsistence hunters, those who use SSL for food or art, as well as  boaters, pilots, and others who spend time on the water.  From the survey data, local seasonal haulouts were  identified, protocols were developed for community-based monitoring of local seasonal haulouts, and testing  protocols were implemented to ensure reporting of survey results.  TASSC is also producing an Alaska Native  Hunter's Photographic Guide to SSL Biosampling.  This guide will include the following topics: health  assessment, nutritional and contaminant sampling, estimating SSL weight, whisker analysis, and SSL stomach  rocks. Also, the dynamics for ""seal finger"" in man, an arthritic-like, painful, contagious disease affecting the  hands and acquired from seals and SSLs, would be addressed.  The project was scheduled to be completed in July  of 2006, with a final report available soon after.    Another important project along similar lines was conducted by the Bristol     ",,2,

Although green and apparently photosynthetic, the species considered here are all capable of  surviving for years with only sporadic above-ground growth, apparently drawing reserves from the host  plants with which they have mycorrhizal connections.

Effective stewardship of ecological structures, processes, and functions sustains culturally  important natural resources, places, and traditions, as well as connections between people and  landscapes (Hess et al. 2008, Lynn et al. 2011). Consultation with Native American tribes is  critical to understand relationships between restoration actions and cultural heritage.  Traditional Ecological Knowledge could be applied to burning and restoration practices to  maximize their success. In addition to integrating cultural heritage and tribal treaty rights with  restoration of ecological functions, the Stella Project Area provides a variety of recreational  experiences (see Recreation).  Proposed restoration treatments would be designed to limit impacts on the character of  Inventoried Roadless Areas to provide amenity values associated with old-growth forest while  sustaining dispersed recreation opportunities over time. These recreation offerings are  intended to address the values of diverse constituents, including those who seek quiet and  solitude, and those who wish to use mechanized equipment (see Recreation and Inventoried  Roadless Areas). Stewardship of recreation opportunities is coupled with consideration of the  scenic quality of the Upper Rogue River Watershed. The Action Alternatives are designed to  meet visual quality objectives defined in the Rogue River National Forest's Land and  Resource Management Plan and recognizes aesthetic character as a public ",0,2,

In Hawai'i, a substantial portion of the local population  participates in recreational and subsistence fishing. Fishing in Guam and the Mariana Islands is important  not only in terms of contributing to the subsistence needs of the Chamorro people but also in preserving  their history and identity. Fishing perpetuates traditional knowledge of marine resources and maritime  heritage of the ancient Chamorro culture (Ka'ai'ai, 2016). In American Samoa, fish brought to shore  continue to be distributed within Samoan villages according to age-old ceremonial traditions. Similar  traditions are still practiced in Hawai'i, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. These sociocultural  attributes of fishing are at least as important as the contributions made to the nutritional or economic  wellbeing of island residents (WPRFMC, 2016).
